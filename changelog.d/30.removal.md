* The `Centerline` class will no longer extend the Shapely's `MultiLineString` because `Centerline` sets custom attributes which will be prohibited starting from Shapely 2.0. You can use `centerline.geometry` instead of `centerline` wherever you need access to the object's geometry.
* Drop Python 2.7 support
